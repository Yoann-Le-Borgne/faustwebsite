# Tools

A wide range of tools gravitate around the Faust programming language 
(an [overview](../doc/manual/index.html#overview-of-the-faust-universe) of
them is presented in the Faust manual). Some can be used directly online and
are available on this website:

* [The Faust Online Editor](editor)
* [The Faust Playground](playground)
* [The Faust Online Compiler](compiler) 

<!-- TODO: eventually we'd want to have another section on "other tools"
providing some sort of basic documentation to FaustLive, FaustWorks, the 
FaustPlayground, etc. -->
