you have a question about the Faust language, the use of one of its associated
tools (e.g., FaustLive, the web editor, etc.), or if you just want to follow the
latest Faust news, please subscribe and ask your question to:

If you'd like to follow the development of Faust an of its associated tools
and/or if you wish to contribute to it, please subscribe and ask your question 
to:
