# Learning Faust

### Faust Kadenze Course

In 2018, Yann Orlarey and Romain Michon shot an online course on the [Kadenze platform](https://www.kadenze.com) on **Real Time Audio Signal Processing in Faust**. The videos of this course are free to [watch online](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/real-time-audio-signal-processing-in-faust/info).

### [Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu)

Several courses on Faust are given at CCRMA:

* [Julius Smith's Faust tutorial](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/aspf/)
* [Romain Michon's Faust tutorials](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/faustTutorials/)
* [Music 250a (Physical Interaction Design for Music) course which hosts various tutorials on Faust and hardware](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/250a-winter-2020/ )
* [Music 320c (Audio Plugin Development in Faust and C++)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/320c/)
* [Embedded DSP With Faust Workshop](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/faust-embedded-19/)

### TU Berlin

The regular [sound synthesis class](https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/lehre/vergangene_semester/sommersemester_2020/sound_synthesis/) at the Audio Communication Group, TU Berlin, makes use of Faust for exploring the basics of different synthesis algorithms. Student projects based on Faust include Eurorack modules, standalone drum machines and synthesizers, as well as data sonification approaches. The class is taught by [Henrik von Coler](https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/wissenschaftliche_mitarbeiter/henrik_von_coler/), who is director of the Electronic Studio at the TU.

### HPI Potsdam

The class [Data Sonification & Opportunities of Sound](https://hpi.de/studium/im-studium/lehrveranstaltungen/cybersecurity-ma/lehrveranstaltung/wise-20-21-3154-data-sonification--opportunities-of-sound.html) at Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam Potsdam, is an interdisciplinary format, exploring the use of sonification and sound synthesis in the context of design thinking, neurosience and medical applications. The signal processing part is taught by [Henrik von Coler](http://hvc.berlin/about/).

### [Université Paris 8](https://www.univ-paris8.fr)
A 24 hours introduction to Faust is given by [Alain Bonardi](http://alainbonardi.net) during the first semester to undergraduated students (L3, 3rd year after the french 'baccalauréat') in the framework of the course "Programming Languages in Computer Music 1" offered in the "Music creation with computers" minor.


### [Universidad Nacional de Quilmes](http://www.unq.edu.ar/)

Cursos de Faust / DSP en español, realizados por [Juan Ramos](http://jaoramos.com.ar). Incluyen las clases del "Seminario de Actualización en Sonido, Ciencia y Tecnología II", dictado en la Universidad Nacional de Quilmes (Argentina) en 2021.

Faust / DSP courses in Spanish, prepared by [Juan Ramos](http://jaoramos.com.ar). They include the classes of the "Update Seminar on Sound, Science and Technology II", held at the National University of Quilmes (Argentina) in 2021:

- An intro video is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnBI7r273BE)
- All available classes are [located here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6aeS3GdkEmt86KUehr8LQ/videos)


### Professional Masters of RIM & RAN

The [Professional RIM & RAN Masters](https://musinf.univ-st-etienne.fr/indexGB.html) are aimed at developing students applied knowledge and understanding of electronic and digital technologies for the creation, prepare them to the professions of *Producer in Computer Music (RIM - Réalisateur en Informatique Musicale) and in Digital Arts (RAN - Réalisateur en Arts Numériques)*. These producers are direct actors in musical and artistic productions, and work at the interface between software developers, applied computer scientists, composers, artists, etc. and all people likely to integrate video, image and sound in their activities.

Most of the courses concerning signal processing are given around the Faust language (M1 Romain Michon 12h / M2 Yann Orlarey 20h).
