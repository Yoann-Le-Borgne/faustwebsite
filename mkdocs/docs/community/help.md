# Getting Help

## Faust Mailing Lists

Mailing lists are by far the best way to reach out to the Faust community. If you have a question about the Faust language, the use of one of its associated tools (e.g., FaustLive, the web editor, etc.), or if you just want to follow the latest Faust news, please subscribe and ask your question to:

* [**the Faust Users Mailing List**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/lists/faudiostream-users)

If you'd like to follow the development of Faust and of its associated tools and/or if you wish to contribute to it, please subscribe and ask your question to:

* [**the Faust Developers Mailing List**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/lists/faudiostream-devel) 


## Faust on discord 

* Connnect to the [Faust discord](https://discord.gg/vzh7CggBtj) server

* The [Audio Programmer community](https://theaudioprogrammer.com/community) discord community has a #faust channel.

## Faust slack channel

Slack is probably the fastest way to get help with Faust: <https://faustaudio.slack.com> or [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/faustaudio/shared_invite/zt-a624szlz-fL4v2DTR~ZGlI7wARryT7g).

## Faust GitHub discussion

The discussions can also take place on the Faust GitHub [discussion forum](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/discussions).
