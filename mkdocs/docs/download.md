#Faust Downloads

Faust comes in many different forms and it can be confusing to know what to install to start using this tool. We recommend you to have a look at the overview of the Faust universe section of the [Faust manual](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/raw/master-dev/documentation/faust-manual/faustManual.pdf). That being said, most of the features of Faust are accessible through the [Faust online editor](https://fausteditor.grame.fr) or the [Faust IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr), so we recommend most people to use these tools which doesn’t require any installation. Now, if you really wish to have a local version of Faust on your system, this page should give you an overview of the options that you have.

We aim at facilitating the installation of Faust and of some of its associated tools by providing pre-compiled binaries and installation packages. However, at this point we recommend Faust users to compile Faust, libfaust, FaustLive, Faustgen, and FaustWorks.

## Faust Compiler &amp; libfaust

While of series of packages containing [pre-compiled versions](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/releases) of the Faust compiler for MacOS and Windows, there is no binary distribution for Linux, where users have to compile Faust from scratch using the latest [stable release](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/releases) of the Faust compiler.
See the [Build Instructions](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/wiki) for details on how to compile.

FaustLive is available in binary or source form from the [FaustLive github repository](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustlive/releases)

## Faustgen
